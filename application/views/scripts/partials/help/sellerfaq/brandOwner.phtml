	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">What is brand verification?</h3>
    <p>Brand verification allows you to set up all your agents on ShipServ Pages but it also means suppliers joining the platform cannot claim authorised status unless approved by you.</p>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h3 id="q2">We are already on Pages. How do we start authorising suppliers?</h3>
    <p>From the Self Service Tool, step 4: Brands. There you will see the 'Brand ownership form which you can fill in. See <a href="#" class="goUpd">here</a> how to access the Self Service Tool.</p>

    <p>Once ShipServ customer team verifies and approves your status, they will turn on the brand verification feature on your profile and you may access this through your Pages profile:</p>
    
    <!--<p>If you don���t have brand verification turned on your profile, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you already have the brand verification system on, you may access this through your Pages profile:</p>-->
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/11.jpg" border="0"/>
    <p>After clicking <strong>Brands</strong>, you will see the <strong>Brand Verification</strong> page.�� From here, you can see all the suppliers who have added your brand to their profiles on ShipServ Pages.  You can review their requests and proceed to authorize or reject.</p>
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/12.jpg" border="0"/>
    <p>If your distributor is an existing supplier in Pages, enter the name of your distributor and click the <strong>Add new supplier for this brand</strong> button.�� Once added, it will show up in the list of suppliers, you may indicate if they are an <strong>authorized agent, authorized installer/repairer</strong> or <strong>Certified Genuine/Original spares</strong> by ticking on the options.</p>
    <p>If your supplier/distributor does not show up in the auto-suggest, click the <strong>Can't find supplier in the list? Invite them via email</strong> button so they can be registered on ShipServ Pages as well.</p>
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/13.jpg" border="0"/>
    <p>Once the suppliers/distributors you have added are fully set up, you will be informed via system-generated email that the supplier has added your brand in their listing for your approval.</p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h3 id="q3">Why should I verify suppliers on ShipServ Pages?</h3>
    <p>This service enables you to control which suppliers can list your brand in their profile with the status of Authorized Agent, Installer/Repairer or Certified Genuine/Original spares.</p>
    <p>Brand verification ensures that the suppliers with genuine and verified links with your brand will be listed higher in search results. Your verified suppliers will get a further boost to their TradeRank while the others will be listed lower in search results.</p>

     <!-- Question 4 -->
    <h3 id="q4">Who verifies suppliers for our brand?</h3>
    <p>Brand verification is only available to profile Administrators on Pages. This person is someone who works for your company. If you don't know who this person is then we can send you a list. Please email us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a></p>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <h3 id="q5">How can I tell if our company's brand verification system is on?</h3>
    <p>If you are not a ShipServ Pages user, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a></p>
    <p>If you are a ShipServ Pages user you can access your Brand Management page under the Profile tab. Please see question <a href="#q2" class="question">We are already on Pages. How do we start authorising suppliers?</a></p>

    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <h3 id="q6">What happens if I reject a supplier's claim as 'Authorised Agent/Installer/Repairer or Certified Genuine/Original spares' for my brand?</h3>
    <p>Then we will remove the 'Authorised Agent/Installer/Repairer or Certified Genuine/Original spares' status from that supplier's profile.  The supplier can still specify that they just supply the brand (no authorisations), but they will appear under 'Other Brands Supplied'.</p>
