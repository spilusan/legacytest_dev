	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">How do I register?</h3>
    <p>There are 3 steps you need to follow to get the full benefits of a Pages Profile:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>
    		<strong><u>Sign in your company to Pages</u></strong><br /><br />
    		<p>You can access the sign in form <a href="https://www.shipserv.com/pages/selfService/main/freeListingLandingPage.jsf">here</a>.</p>
    		<p>By filling in and submitting this form, your company will get a Basic listing on Pages. This is a completely FREE service that will allow buyers to find you amongst more than 50,000 suppliers. At this point you can only access and edit your listing with the link you receive in your confirmation email.</p>
    		<p>Listings can be Premium or basic. We recommend you take a Premium Profile as, on average, you'll get more profile views, more views of your contact information, and more RFQs.</p>
            <p>Premium Profiles are only available as part of ShipServ Membership, which also includes unlimited order management, brand verification on ShipServ Pages, 24/7 customer support and the Supplier Insight Report.</p>
    		<p>Click <a href="/info/pages-for-suppliers/win-new-business-with-a-premium-listing/">here</a> to learn more about Premium Profiles and how to upgrade to full Membership.</p>
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<strong><u>Become a Pages user</u></strong><br /><br />
    		<p>It only takes 1 minute to become a user: click <a href="/user/register-login/register">here</a> and fill in your details, then click the 'Register me' button.</p>
    		<p>By registering as a user, you will have a username and password that will allow you to log in to Pages. Only logged in users can see the contact details tab.</p>
    	</li>
    	<li id="q1-1">
    		<strong><u>Connect to your company</u></strong><br /><br />
    		<p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    		<ol>
    			<li>
    				<p>Send the request through ShipServ Pages. You don't need to know who the administrator is this way as ShipServ automatically sends the request to the right person - but you will need to wait for the administrator to approve your request. Here are some screenshots of what you do:</p>
    				<p>Log in to Pages using your username and password. Then go to 'My companies' under the Profile tab and click 'My Companies'. Here you will see all companies you have joined as well as an 'Add company' button, at the right hand side of the screen. If you click it, a blank field will appear where you can search for suppliers or for buyers, either by name or TNID. Click invite.</p>
    				<img src="/img/help/supplier/01.jpg" border="0"/>
    				<p>We'll then send your request to the administrator of this company for approval.</p>
    				<p>When they have approved your request you will then have access to the Supplier Insight Report.</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<p>Email the administrator of your Pages Profile, if you know who they are, and they can add you. If you don't know who they are, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a> and we will let you know.</p>
    				<p>If you do not register as a user and connect to your company you will not be able to see the Supplier Insight Report of your company, showing statistics, your Pages RFQs, your Profile and Contact views.</p>
    			</li>
    		</ol>
    	</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h3 id="q2">I signed my company to ShipServ Pages but I can't get back in.</h3>
    <p>Just by registering your company, you don't automatically become a user of Pages, i.e. you don't automatically get a username and password to log in to Pages</p>
    <p>You need to become a Pages user and connect to your company to get the full benefits of a Pages Listing. To see how, see answer to <a rel="#q1" class="question">Question 1</a></p>
    <p>If you did register as a user and can't log into Pages, simply click our password reminder or email us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a></p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h3 id="q3">How do I connect to my company?</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>
    		<p>Send the request through ShipServ Pages. You don't need to know who the administrator is this way as ShipServ automatically sends the request to the right person - but you will need to wait for the administrator to approve your request.</p>
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		<p>Email the administrator of your Pages Profile, if you know who they are, and they can add you. If you don't know who they are, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a> and we will let you know.</p>
    	</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <h3 id="q4">How do I add someone else so they can see the Supplier Insight Report and the RFQ Inbox?</h3>
    <p>If you are a Pages User, then you need to ask an Administrator of the Company Profile to add other users.</p>
    <p>If you are an Administrator, this is what you do:</p>
    <p>If you've received an email from someone in your company asking to be a ShipServ Pages User for your company then you can add them. It does not matter if they are already registered on Pages or not - the process for you is the same. (But note this can only be done if you are an administrator. If your company does not have an administrator then contact our customer service team on <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a>).</p>
    <p>After logging in to ShipServ Pages, click on the Profile tab. On the Profile page, click 'Users' at the left panel of the page. Here you will see any pending requests from users wanting to join the company. To add them, you simply confirm by clicking 'Yes, add this person'.</p>
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/02.jpg" width="660" border="0"/>
    <p>OR, as an administrator, you can add your colleagues on this page. Click on the Add Users button. Once you click it, a box would show up just like below asking you to enter the email address of your colleague. After entering the email address, choose an option between making that person a User or an Admin and click the 'Invite' button.</p>
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/03.jpg" width="660" border="0"/>
    <p>Then wait for your colleague to click on the Accept link in the email that he will receive. Once he accepts it, his name would then show on the list of the current members of your company.</p>

     <!-- Question 5 -->
     <h3 id="q5">I am a Pages User, how do I become an Administrator?</h3>
     <p>You need to ask an administrator to make you administrator as well. There is no limit as to how many admins a company can have. If you don't know who they are, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a> and we will let you know.</p>

     <!-- Question 6 -->
     <h3 id="q6">Why should I register on Pages?</h3>
     <p>ShipServ Pages is busier than ever. More buyers than ever before are registered to use Pages RFQs. We achieved this traffic increase through natural growth, more returning buyers and SEO (search engine optimisation) activity that our marketing team carries out on an ongoing basis. All this is designed to drive more RFQs and profile views to our suppliers.</p>

     <!-- Question 7 -->
     <h3 id="q7">Why should I connect to my company?</h3>
     <p>If you do not register as a user and connect to your company you will not be able to see the Supplier Insight Report of your company, showing statistics, your Pages RFQs, your Profile and Contact views.</p>
     <p>Click <a rel="#q1-1" class="question">here</a> for information on how to connect to a company.</p>
