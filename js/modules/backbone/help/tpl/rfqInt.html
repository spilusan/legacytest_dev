	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">Why can't I receive both Pages and TradeNet RFQs in my System?</h3>
    <p>At present we have turned this feature off for all integrated suppliers due to the bespoke setup required.</p>
    <p>Your service delivery manager will contact you shortly to assist you in importing the Pages RFQ into your system.</p>
    <p>If you would like any further information about this process please contact <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a></p>
