	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">Why am I receiving more RFQs in my SmartSupplier inbox?</h3>
	<p>We know how important it is to find new business.  To make sure you do not miss out on any leads, we will now send RFQs from both ShipServ TradeNet and ShipServ Pages to your SmartSupplier. </p>

	<!-- Question 2 -->
	<h3 id="q2">What is the benefit?</h3>
	<p>With all your RFQs now in one place they can be processed quicker and more efficiently.</p>

	<!-- Question 3 -->
	<h3 id="q3">Do I need to do anything special to respond to these RFQ's?</h3>
	<p>You need to action your RFQs by either quoting or declining them. If you are a ShipServ Member, and benefit from the SmartSupplier order management software, you can action them there. Leads taken off ShipServ will carry an additional charge.</p>

	<!-- Question 4 -->
	<h3 id="q4">How can I block a buyer with whom I do not wish to do business?</h3>
	<p>Simply log in to your Pages account and maintain the blocked list from there.  To find out more about blocking a buyer please <a href="#" class="goMax">click here</a>.</p> 
	<p>If you have any difficulty doing so, our customer support will be happy to assist you. Email <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a>.</p>

	<!-- Question 5 -->
	<h3 id="q5">How do I increase the number and/or quality of the RFQs I receive?</h3>
	<p>We recommend you look carefully at your listing on ShipServ Pages and specifically what categories and brands you have selected. You might need to change them, delete some, or add to them. You need to access the <a href="#" class="goUpd">Self Service Tool</a> to make changes to your listing. It might help to talk this through with an account manager so please feel free to <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
