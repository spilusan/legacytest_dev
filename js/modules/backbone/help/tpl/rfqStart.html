	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">Why am I receiving RFQs from ShipServ Pages?</h3>
    <p>We know how important it is to find new business.Â  To make sure you do not miss out on any leads, we will now send RFQs from both ShipServ TradeNet and ShipServ Pages to your StartSupplier.</p>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h3 id="q2">What is the benefit?</h3>
    <p>You will be able to receive and respond through StartSupplier to all RFQs. </p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h3 id="q3">Do I need to do anything special to respond to these RFQs?</h3>
    <p>No. Just respond the same way you would to any other RFQ. All RFQs received from ShipServ Pages will be marked 'ShipServ Pages from [Buyer name]' in your StartSupplier inbox.</p>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <h3 id="q4">How can I block a buyer with whom I do not wish to do business?</h3>
    <p>Simply log in to your Pages account and maintain the blocked list from there. To find out more about blocking a buyer please <a href="#" class="goMax">click here</a> and choose 'I'm getting RFQs but they are not relevant to my business. What can I do?'.</p>
    <p>If you have any difficulty doing so, our customer support will be happy to assist you. Email <a href="mailto:support@shipserv.com">support@shipserv.com</a>.<br/> 
    <i> Note: blocking one buyer will not impact any others.</i></p>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <h3 id="q5">Can I still access RFQs through ShipServ Pages?</h3>
    <p>You will still have access to your ShipServ Pages RFQs in the RFQ Inbox once you are signed in to ShipServ Pages, but (as now) you will not see any TradeNet RFQs. </p>

    <!-- Question 6 -->
    <h3 id="q6">I have forgotten my StartSupplier login details.</h3>
    <p>Just click on the 'Forgotten Password' link on the StartSupplier login page</p>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <h3 id="q7">How do I increase the number and/or quality of the RFQs I receive?</h3>
    <p>We recommend you look carefully at your listing on ShipServ Pages and specifically what categories and brands you have selected. You might need to change them, delete some, or add to them. You need to access the <a href="#" class="goUpd">Self Service Tool</a> to make changes to your listing.</p>
    <p>It might help to talk this through with an account manager so please feel free to <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
