	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">What is a Review?</h3>
    <p>ShipServ's Reviews function enables buyers to leave comments on supplier performance and enables suppliers to seek reviews on their service levels.</p>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h3 id="q2">Why should I ask for reviews from buyers?</h3>
    <p>There are two benefits:</p>
    <p><strong>Improves your rank</strong> - having more reviews improves your TradeRank, which is one of the factors in search results ranking. The higher you appear in search results the more Pages RFQs you are likely to receive. </p>
    <p><strong>Improves trust</strong> - the better your Profile is, the more confident new buyers will become. This increases your chances of being included in their RFQ lists.</p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h3 id="q3">How do I ask for reviews?</h3>
    <p>After you have logged in to your profile, click on the company profile page and then click on the Reviews Tab.</p>

    <p>On the Reviews tab, you can see the names of all the buyers you have traded with on ShipServ TradeNet as well as your trading frequency with them.</p>
    <p>If a buyer didn't review you yet, you can click on the “Ask their opinion” link, at the bottom left side of the screen.</p>

    <p>You have the option to enter the email address of the recipient you wish to send the request to. Providing an email address is not necessary as we will send this notification to our contact from the buyer company as well.</p>
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/17.png" border="0" alt="">
    <p>Buyers that you traded with are able to proactively review you, without you having to invite them to do so via the 'Ask their opinion' button.</p>
