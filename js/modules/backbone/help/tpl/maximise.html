	<!-- Question 1 -->
    <h3 id="q1">What benefits do I get if I have a Premium Profile that I don't get as a basic lister?</h3>
    <p>There are a series of advantages, including:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>All Premium Profiles are returned higher in the search results than basic listings.</li>
    	<li>A highlighted and expanded listing.</li>
    	<li>Use of 7 additional features (including company logo display, for example).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click <a href="/help/premium">here</a> for more details on the benefits of a Premium Profile.</p>
    <p>Please remember that Premium Profile is part of the ShipServ Membership package, alongside unlimited order management with the SmartSupplier software, brand control, 24/7 customer support and the Supplier Insight Report – a set of tools that measure the results you get from Pages.</p>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <h3 id="q2">What should I do to maximise my profile? </h3>
    <p><strong>Do two things:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>Invest in a Premium Profile AND</strong></li>
    	<li><strong>Make sure your profile is very well completed.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is an explanation of why these are important.</p>
    <p>ShipServ uses a powerful and complex algorithm to decide which of our 50,000 suppliers gets returned after a User does a search, and in which order.</p>
    <p>Put simply, we consider ALL these three things:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>What suppliers SAY they do (their Pages profile)</li>
    	<li>What they ACTUALLY do (their trading on TradeNet) and</li>
    	<li>What their CUSTOMERS say they do (reviews).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>So a supplier's profile is a really important part of them being ranked</u></strong> - or not</p>
    <p><strong>Premium Profiles are significantly advantaged</strong> versus basic listers</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Premium profile is much more complete than basic so they get returned in search result more often</li>
    	<li>All Premium suppliers are shown before all basic suppliers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, basic listers:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>CANNOT show company logo and business description</li>
    	<li>CANNOT upload any attachments such as product lists or brochures</li>
    	<li>ARE ONLY allowed to list in 3 categories and for ONLY 3 brands they supply.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basic listers will not be returned in as many search results and so <u>miss out on RFQs</u>.</p>
    <p>In any case, whether you have a basic or Premium listing, the <strong><u>more comprehensive and detailed your profile</u></strong> the more new business you will get through ShipServ Pages. We use all parts of your profile to determine search results.</p>
    <p>Remember, the average profile complete score of a Premium profile is 45% so there is significant opportunity to improve that and drive greater performance for you from ShipServ.</p>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <h3 id="q3">How can I know who in our company receives the RFQs sent to us through Pages?</h3>
    <p>Check your StartSupplier emails or your SmartSupplier Inbox. Alternatively, you can always see your RFQs in your RFQ Inbox, on Pages, under the 'Trade' tab.</p>

     <!-- Question 4 -->
    <h3 id="q4">What do I need to do with the RFQs I get in my SmartSupplier Inbox?</h3>
    <p>You need to action your RFQs by either quoting or declining them. If you are a ShipServ Member, and benefit from the SmartSupplier order management software, you can action them there. Leads taken off ShipServ will carry an additional charge.</p>

     <!-- Question 5 -->
    <h3 id="q5">I'm getting RFQs but they are not relevant to my business. What can I do?</h3>
    <p>We recommend you look carefully at your profile and specifically at what categories and brands you have selected. You might need to change them, delete some, or add to them. Please see <a href="#" class="goUpd">here</a> how to edit your profile </p>
    <p>If you've included categories that are wrong or not your core business then this may well be why you are getting less relevant RFQs. If you're a specialist supplier and what you supply only corresponds to one (or few) of our categories then we recommend strongly you only select those and don't select partially relevant categories. If you need us to create new categories please get in touch with our support teams.</p>
    <p>Increasing the level of detail on your profile, by adding more to the free format areas, or uploading your product brochures or catalogues, will also help.</p>
    <p>Also, as a supplier, you are now able to opt-out from receiving RFQs from a specific buyer. You can do this by logging in to Pages, going to your Trade tab and then open an RFQ in your RFQ Inbox. You will then see the BLOCK button at the bottom.</p>
    <img src="/img/help/supplier/09.jpg" border="0"/>
    <p>You can block as many buyers as you wish.</p>
    <p>To view all the buyers you (and the other Pages Users in your company) have already blocked please go to the Profile tab and click on 'RFQ Blocked list'.</p>
    <p>Finally, it might help to talk this through with an account manager so please feel free to <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a></p>
