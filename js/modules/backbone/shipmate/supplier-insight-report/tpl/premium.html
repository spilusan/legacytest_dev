    <h1>Profile views drive brand awareness of your company on ShipServ</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Profile views are the best measure of how much exposure your company is getting on ShipServ Pages, the world's most used marine search engine.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>These views are buyers in active search mode looking at your company.</h2>
    <p>
        So look out for calls, emails and RFQs sent directly to you.<br>
        Buyers view your profile when they are deciding who to send their RFQs to.<br>
        <br>
        They will then send their RFQs to chosen suppliers in the following ways:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Via ShipServ if they are one of our 200 integrated buyers</li>
            <li>Via email/PDF/excel/phone directly to you, if they are one of hundreds of buyers not on ShipServ</li>
        </ul>
