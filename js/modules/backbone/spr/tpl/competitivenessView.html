                The breakdown of the number of competitive quote situations the supplier has been in. A competitiveness quote situation or
                CQS is where at least one other supplier has been chosen to quote on an RFQ. The number of situations is
                shown and the number of times the supplier is cheapest or their response is fastest. We also show the average
                percentage the supplier was cheaper or more expensive comparing to the nearest cheapest or most expensive
                quote respectively.
