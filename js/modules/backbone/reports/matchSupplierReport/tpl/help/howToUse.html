				<span>Activate AutoSource to automatically get comparison quotes from high-quality suppliers</span>
			</div>	
			<p>
				By activating AutoSource, the ShipServ system will start scanning all your RFQs and will get extra quotes from high-quality suppliers where high potential savings exist. You have the option to only be notified of the extra quotes if they are cheaper than quotes from your normal suppliers. This allows you to ensure that you are always getting quotes from the most competitive suppliers.

				<span>Benchmark the performance of your usual suppliers against the suppliers being recommended</span>
			</div>	
			<p>
				This report shows you which of the recommended suppliers are offering the highest potential savings when compared to the best performing suppliers that you select yourself. You can drill down to see all the quotes that the recommended supplier has issued and can compare other factors such as quality, lead time, delivery costs and payment terms.

				<span>Approve and start using the recommended suppliers that can deliver savings to reduce operating costs</span>
			</div>	
			<p>
				If you see a supplier consistently delivering savings you should add them as an approved vendor to replace or augment your existing suppliers. You can then trade with them on a regular basis to turn potential savings into actual savings. The system will continue to monitor their performance against other possible suppliers to ensure you are always using the most competitive suppliers.
