    <p>Banner adverts for your company appear on ShipServ Pages. Every time the banner appears to a visitor then this is counted
        as 1 impression. The user then decides if they want to click on the banner.
    </p>
    <p>You will have previously consented to take or buy banner adverts. The nature of the targeting which determines the pages
        on which your banner appears would have been agreed with you when they were first set up.
    </p>
    <p>If this is shown as 0 [zero] then this means you have not taken any banner advertising on ShipServ.</p>
