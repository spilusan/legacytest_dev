<h1 class="styled">Compare To Market</h1>
<div class="modalContent">
<p>The Market average benchmarks are displayed under your Profile and Contact Views numbers. To change the makeup of the benchmarks click on the word edit.  This opens a pop up with 4 tabs (such as 'Countries & Ports') which you can click into and change in any way you wish. So, for example, you may wish to see the Market benchmarks for only your categories and ports. (If you wish to change the time period, click the Time Period drop down.)
Once you have made your changes to the default settings and clicked 'Apply Changes' all the Market averages will be re-calculated. So you will then see revised figures for the averages.</p>
<p>The default view on log in shows a 12 month timeframe and the Market bar graphs are set as the average for all the 52,000 suppliers we have on ShipServ. You are able to change all these defaults, as described above.</p>
