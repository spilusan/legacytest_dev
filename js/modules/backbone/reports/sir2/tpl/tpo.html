<h1 class="styled">Total PO value</h1>
<div class="modalContent">
<p>This is the total value of Purchase Orders on TradeNet during the selected time period (historical data starts from 2009). This is always in USD.</p>
<p>In any selected time period, ShipServ will use the latest PO value, or the latest POC (Purchase Order Confirmation) value where one exists, for all new transactions in that selected time period.</p>
<p>If a PO is in a different currency to USD then this value is converted to USD on the day the PO is issued. The exchange rate used is updated daily.</p>
<p>Where a PO has no value or an invalid currency, the median value of all POs in the last 12 months will be used.</p>
