<p>This is the number of unique buyers from which you received Purchase Orders on ShipServ during the selected time period.</p>
<p>Please note that several of our buyers ask to be set up with several different buyer TradeNet ID’s – one each for their different locations, branches, yards etc. In this report we count the number of different buyer TNIDs so some buyers who you might consider as just 1 unique buyer might be counted as several buyers here.</p>
