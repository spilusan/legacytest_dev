If these were the only 4 quotes you made in the period you have selected then:<br>
<ul>
	<li style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Quotes won by lowest price – 50%</li>
	<li style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">How often are you the lowest – 75%</li>
</ul>

<p>To see the number of direct quotes you made hover your cursor over the quotes number in the funnel.</p>
 
<p>Less than 100% of line items quoted<br>
This is of all competitive quotes regardless of the % of line items quoted. So if a quote only has 1 of the 10 line items completed then we will still compare this quote against the other quotes from other suppliers.</p>
