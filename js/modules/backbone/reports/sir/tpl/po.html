<h1 class="styled">POs/Orders</h1>
<div class="modalContent">
	<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Of the RFQs number shown in the funnel, this is the number you have since won.<br /><br />We only count the PO if its RFQ also came in during the same period selected. If you won a PO whose RFQ came in before the period selected, we won't count it here.</p>
	<p>This means some POs you won in this period might not be counted in this number (i.e. we DON'T count a PO you won if its RFQ came in before the period selected).</p>
	<p><u>Why?</u></p>
	<p>We do this to make sure the win rate shown in this report is as accurate as possible. If we counted a PO but not its RFQ/quote then the win rate would be incorrect (too high).</p>
	<p>For the same reason, when we see an RFQ and its PO but we cannot see your quote on ShipServ, we will add a "balancing" quote to your quote count to make the quote rate and win rate accurate.</p>
	<p>To see the total number of POs you won in a period regardless of when the RFQ was received, go to the billable transactions tab (only available to Members).</p>
	<p>Let's see two examples. Today is August and you set the <strong>period of the report to the month of May only:</strong></p>
	<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 15px;">
		<li style="color: red; padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">An RFQ received in April, quoted in May and won in May – this May order is not counted (the RFQ will not count in the funnel as the RFQ is outside the period of the report, so the quote is not counted either, nor is the order)</li>
		<li style="color: green; padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">An RFQ received in May, quoted in June and won in July – this July order will be counted (because the RFQ was received in the period of the report, does not matter that the quote and order were done after the period)</li>
	</ul>
	<p><u>Direct POs</u></p>
	<p>Where your PO was received without preceding RFQ on ShipServ, we count this as a DIRECT order.</p>
	<p>Direct orders are not shown in this number – they are shown in a separate box on the Sales funnel.</p>
