<div class="modalContent">
	<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">This shows how you compare to other suppliers for the same quotes.</p>
	<p>We only count quotes here which meet all these criteria:</p>
	<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 15px;">
		<li style="padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">where at least 2 suppliers issued a quote (one of which has to be you)</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">and where there is an PO issued (which may or may not have been to you)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In the table at the bottom, we divide your quotes up into quote time bands and show your win rate by that band.</p>
	<p>We show you what % of your quotes you do in these time bands.</p>
	<p>If there are insufficient quotes to show you reliable data, or protect the confidentiality of other suppliers and buyers, we show "n/a".</p>
