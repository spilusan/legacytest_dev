<h1 class="styled">Quotes</h1>
<div class="modalContent">
	<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">Of the RFQs number shown in the funnel, this is the number you have since quoted.<br /><br />
	We only count the quote if its RFQ also came in during the same period selected. If you did a quote whose RFQ came in before the period selected, we won't count it here.</p>

	<p>This means some quotes you made in this period might not be counted in this number (i.e. we DON’T count a quote you did if its RFQ came in before the period selected).</p>

	<p><u>Why?</u></p>
	<p>We do this to make sure the quote rate shown in this report is as accurate as possible. If we counted a quote but not its RFQ the quote rate would be incorrect (too high).</p>
	<p>For the same reason, when we see an RFQ and its PO but we cannot see your quote on ShipServ, we will add a "balancing" quote to your quote count to make the quote rate and win rate accurate.</p>
	<p>To see the actual number of quotes you made in a period (regardless of when the RFQ was received, and regardless of any "balancing" quotes we added), go to the billable transactions tab (only available to Members).</p>
	<p>Let's see some examples. Today is March and you set the <strong>period of the report to the month of January only:</strong></p>
	<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 15px;">
		<li style="color: red; padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">An RFQ received in December was quoted in January – this January quote would not be counted (even though the quote is done in the period of the report, the RFQ it relates to was received in December, outside the period of the report)</li>
		<li style="color: green; padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">An RFQ received in January was quoted in January – this January quote would be counted</li>
		<li style="color: green; padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">An RFQ received in January was quoted in February – this February quote would count (RFQ received in the period of the report, does not matter when you quoted)</li>
		<li style="color: green; padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">An RFQ received in February was quoted in February – this February quote would not be counted (RFQ received after the period of the report)</li>
	</ul>
