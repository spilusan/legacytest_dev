<h1 class="styled">Quotes lost</h1>
<div class="modalContent">
	<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;">The number of quotes you have lost.<br /><br />It's the difference between the quotes and PO numbers in the blue bars above.<br /><br />The value is ShipServ's best estimate of the value of your lost quotes.</p>
	<p><u>Important note on data confidentiality</u></p>
	<p>We take supplier and buyer confidentiality very seriously (we are held to tight contractual obligations and in addition we could not run our business if this obligation was compromised).</p>
	<p>As a result:</p>
	<ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 15px;">
		<li style="padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">We will not show the value of individual RFQs which make up this total</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"> We will not show any number which is not aggregated (i.e. it will not be possible to trace back to an individual supplier's data)</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">In cases where this is at risk you will see this box disappear and no data shown</li>
	</ul>
