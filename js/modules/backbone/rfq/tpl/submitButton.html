<h1 class="styled">Send RFQ</h1>
<div class="modalContent">
	Every RFQ sent through Pages is subject to a quality control process to make sure your RFQs abide by the rules of Pages and so buyers get good quality RFQs.  To see those rules â€“ <a href="/help#8" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br />
	<br />
	For first time senders, this means a manual check by our Pages RFQ quality team. This will delay the sending of your RFQ by an average of 12 hours.<br />
	<br />
	For those that have send RFQs before, we have regular manual and automatic checks in place.<br />
	<br />
	<b>Remember that your RFQ MUST relate to specific products or services which you are purchasing.</b><br /> 
	<br />
	<b>General requests, introductions, or requests for price lists or expressions of interest are NOT allowed, will be blocked, and the user's right to send further RFQs will be disabled.</b><br />

	Thanks for using ShipServ Pages.<br />
