349,260 events (total of rows in all 3 source tables) - 1 week's worth of data
226,635 were tagged with a session id (untagged mainly e.g. browser = crawler rows)
Took circa 10mins to run

If a user acts on the site, then logs in, acts, logs out, then acts again, we would have user recorded across a session's events like this:

null, ..., user_id, ... , null ...

This implementation would split such a session into 3 sessions.

We recently (Feb?) added code to the app which updates events retrospectively at log-in time. The same situation would therefore be recorded as:

user_id, ..., user_id, null ...

This remedies the issue for recent events, but means that such sessions are incorrectly restored prior to changing the app.

One further point - it would be nice if the app remembers a user after log-out so as to produce:

user_id, ..., user_id, user_id, ...

I doubt that it does this.
